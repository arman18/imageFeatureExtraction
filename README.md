### Hough Transform

'''
The Hough transform (HT) is a feature extraction approach in image processing.
The HT is a method for separating features of a certain shape inside a picture. The classical HT is most typically employed to detect regular curves such as lines, circles, ellipses, etc.
The real benefit of the HT approach is that it is unaffected by picture noise and is tolerant of gaps in feature boundary descriptions.
